# Predicting Road Team Wins in Sports Using Machine Learning

This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict whether the **road team** wins a given sports match. The data originates from a **Kaggle competition**.

## Objectives

- Load and preprocess game data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Train classification models to predict the binary outcome: whether the road team won (`1`) or lost (`0`)
- Evaluate model performance using different metrics and visualization techniques

## Project structure

- Load data and libraries
- Visualize data
- Process data (to make it suitable for training)
- Train models
- Optimize models with GridSearch
- Visualize results

## Results

The results section of the notebook includes:
- Metrics for both default models and optimized models
- Comparison between results with and without SMOTE 
- Confusion matrix for optimized models
